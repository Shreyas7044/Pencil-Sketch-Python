# Pencil-Sketch-Python
Convert any image into a realistic pencil sketch using Python and OpenCV in less than 20 lines of code. This project reads an image, converts it to grayscale, inverts, blurs, and blends it to generate a pencil sketch effect. Simple, fast, beginner-friendly and completely reusable.
